# My Vim Motions for VS Code
For that blazingly fast smooth coconut oil experience in your IDE, here are some keybindings to integrate into your vs code settings.

## Usage
First, install the "Vim" Extension by vscodevim, which is a Vim emulation for Visual Studio Code.
I am using version:`v1.26.2`

### Edit `settings.json`
1. Go to File > Preferences > Settings.
2. Click on the icon button 'Open Settings (JSON)' that should be on the top right of the Settings page.
3. Copy paste the code in the settings.json of this repo into the settings.json of your VS Code IDE.

### Edit `keybindings.json`
1. Go to File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts
2. Click on the icon button 'Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)' that should be on the top right of the Keyboard Shortcuts page.
3. Copy paste the code in the keybindings.json of this repo into the keybindings.json of your VS Code IDE.
